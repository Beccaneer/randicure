<h1>About Randicure</h1>
<br>
<h3> What is Randicure?</h3>
<p>Randicure stands for 'random manicure' and randomly determines how you should paint your nails!
	<br>
	<br>
	A Randicure is reliant on two things: the polishes you have in your collection, and the techniques you want to paint.
	You can add or edit these by using the links at the top.

<h3> How does Randicure work?</h3>
	<p>
		Randicure first randomly picks which technique you should use to paint your nails, then randomly determines which colours you should use
		and which accents you should have based on the settings for that particular technique.
		<br>
		<br>
		Note there are some techniques that might have a set colour scheme and you don't want to generate colours for (eg. a galaxy manicure), in this
		case you can simply set both min and max number of colours to 0, and Randicure won't give you specific polish suggestions. 
	</p>
<h3> Look for these Randicure features in the near future! </h3>
	<p> I plan on continuing to work on Randicure as long as I have time to. 
		<br>
		Here are some features I plan on implementing:
		<ul>
			<li>Ability to blacklist randicures</li>
			<li>Ability to favourite randicures</li>
			<li>Randicure history</li>
			<li>Polish quick add</li>
			<li>Add polishes by colour swatch</li>
		</ul>
